<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Adail Silva</h1>

<h3 align="center">Graduated in Information Systems from UniFacid University Center (Teresina-PI), Post-graduating in Computer Networks from St. Augustine College (Teresina-PI), I work as a full stack Angular and Spring developer for to Development Bank of Minas Gerais S.A. (Belo Horizonte-MG), I also work with the C/C++ language in embedded projects, in addition, I recently ventured to study the flutter framework for mobile application development. And my hobby has been developing Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, using the LoRaWAN protocol stack as the core technology.</h3>

<br/>

I share personal code and projects here on GitHub. My main objective is to share knowledge, mainly about the LoRaWAN protocol, considering all the potential of the protocol and where it can be applied, it all started randomly when I came across articles about Internet of Things in 2018, since then I made friends and exchanged knowledge with people interested in the protocol, we currently form a large community of studies on LoRa and LoRaWAN! I'm a lifelong student, and that means I'm looking forward to sharing what I've learned about software development with you all.

## LoRaWAN protocol
The LoRaWAN protocol is a Low Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN) communication protocol that functions on LoRa. The LoRaWAN specification is open so anyone can set up and operate a LoRa network. LoRa is a wireless audio frequency technology that operates in a license-free radio frequency spectrum.
